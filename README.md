# Certified L∞ Bounded Compression for AI Models - QVB8 Inference Engine

QVB8 stores model weights in a compressed format where **the error of every restored weight is guaranteed to be less than the
error bound τ**. The engine runs the compressed weights directly on the GPU: custom CUDA kernels decode them inside
the matmuls, so large models run on small hardware. It provides an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server and a terminal chat,
with DFlash2 speculative decoding.

The engine is general CUDA code. **Version 1 provides a build for the NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10, sm_121, aarch64).**

## Why certified L∞-bounded compression?

Most quantization is judged by an average: a perplexity or benchmark score. An average hides the worst case. A format can
look good on average and still leave a few weights with a large error, and a large error in the wrong weight can flip a
single token. The result is a sudden wrong word or a stray character from another language in the middle of a normal
answer, which an average score may not show. In our own tests with a 4-bit floating-point format we saw this in server logs.

L∞-bounded means the **largest** error is controlled, not the average. For a QVB8 pack:

- every restored weight differs from the original by less than **τ**, and no tensor is allowed to exceed it;
- the check is made after packing, tensor by tensor, and the largest error found is stored in `manifest.json` (`max_err`);
- τ is your choice: a smaller τ is a tighter bound, a larger file and a perplexity closer to the original; a larger τ is
  a smaller file and a higher perplexity. You choose the trade-off knowing the worst case.

What the bound does **not** do: it covers the stored weights only. It does not promise that the model's answers are
identical to the original's, or correct. See the disclaimer at the end of this file.

## What version 1 supports

- **Model type:** large language models (text in, text out), served through a chat API.
- **Model:** one model so far, **Ripple-65B-Preview** (a dense 65B LLM by Ricursive AI), with its DFlash2 draft model for
  speculative decoding.
- **Weight formats:** QVB8 and QVB8R packs (QVB8R is the smaller, entropy-coded variant).
- **Interfaces:** an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server (streaming, tool calls, reasoning output) and a terminal chat.
- **Not in version 1:** images, video and audio models, image input to the LLM, other LLMs, and creating packs.

| Model | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Ripple-65B-Preview** | LLM (text) | **Version 1: supported** |
| Qwen3.8-27B | LLM (text) | Planned |
| Z-Image, Qwen-Image-Edit, MiniMax-H3 | Image / video | Planned |

## Requirements

- An NVIDIA GPU with about 62 GB of GPU memory for the qvb8 1e-3 pack (about 50 GB for the qvb8r 1e-3 pack), and the CUDA toolkit with `nvcc`.
  Two smaller cards can share one pack: see [Two GPUs](#two-gpus-pipeline-placement).
- **Provided build:** NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10, sm_121, aarch64), Ubuntu 24.04, driver 580, CUDA 13.0, Python 3.12, PyTorch 2.14.
  This is the build that has been tested.
- **Other GPUs:** the source is not tied to one GPU. The kernels compile for your GPU on first use (for example sm_120 on an
  RTX PRO 6000), but only the DGX Spark build is tested for Ripple.
- **Compute dtype, `--dtype bf16|fp16`:** the launchers pass `--dtype bf16`; add `--dtype fp16` after it to run in fp16,
  for example `scripts/ripple_server.sh start --dtype fp16` (the same flag works for `scripts/ripple_chat.sh`). Nothing
  is chosen automatically. A GPU without bf16 support (for example the V100, sm_70) emulates bf16 and is slow, so run it
  in fp16. On a GPU with bf16 (A100, H100, RTX 30/40/50, DGX Spark) both work: test which is faster on your card. The
  packs below are certified for both fp16 and bf16, so the error of every restored weight is less than tau in either
  dtype. fp16 tops out at 65504, so an activation can overflow in fp16 where bf16 would not; compare a few answers
  against bf16 if you can.
- **`escape_tables.json` (needed for fp16):** each pack folder on Hugging Face carries this small file next to
  `manifest.json`. It holds the fp16 escape table: the few weights an fp16 decode must take from the stored originals.
  An fp16 run without it stops at start-up and tells you to download it; a bf16 run does not need it.
  For the V100 the code has its own kernel paths (register-blocked GEMV, WMMA attention) and needs CUDA 12.x, because
  CUDA 13 dropped sm_70. The V100 path is verified on Qwen models, not yet on Ripple.
- Python 3.10+ (tested 3.12) and the packages in `requirements.txt` (tested versions pinned).
- A Ripple target pack and a DFlash2 drafter pack (each pack dir carries its own config, modeling code and tokenizer).

## Weight packs (Hugging Face)

python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
# 1. PyTorch with CUDA support for your platform (see pytorch.org). Tested: 2.14.0 built for CUDA 13.0.
# 2. The other packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
# 3. Optional: flash-attn (faster attention). Without it the engine falls back to PyTorch attention.
#    It must be built against your PyTorch:  pip install flash-attn==2.8.3.post1 --no-build-isolation
```

The CUDA kernels compile automatically on first use (a few minutes) into `.ext_cache/` and are reused after that.

## Run the server

```bash
export MODEL=./models/Ripple-65B-Preview-QVB8-1e-3
export DRAFT=./models/Ripple-65B-Preview-DFlash2-QVB8-5e-3
scripts/ripple_server.sh            # start in the background, wait until ready
scripts/ripple_server.sh status
scripts/ripple_server.sh log        # follow scripts/logs/Ripple-65B.log
scripts/ripple_server.sh stop
scripts/ripple_server.sh restart --no-think    # extra flags go to the server and win
```

Default port is 8080 (override with `PORT=...`). The server speaks the OpenAI chat API:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Write a haiku about rivers"}],"max_tokens":200,"stream":false}'
```

It supports streaming, tool calls (JSON) and the reasoning (`<think>`) channel. It also accepts content-part lists,
as sent by Cline and similar clients.

## Chat in the terminal

```bash
MODEL=... DRAFT=... scripts/ripple_chat.sh                                 # interactive
MODEL=... DRAFT=... scripts/ripple_chat.sh "Explain entropy" --no-interactive
```

## Two GPUs (pipeline placement)

A pack that is too big for one card can be split over two cards in one process: the first decoder layers live on
one card, the rest (plus the embedding, the lm_head and the drafter) on the other, and the hidden state crosses once
per forward pass. Set `QV_PIPELINE_SPLIT`; the same variables work for `scripts/ripple_chat.sh`.

```bash
export MODEL=./models/Ripple-65B-Preview-QVB8-1e-3
export DRAFT=./models/Ripple-65B-Preview-DFlash2-QVB8-5e-3
QV_PIPELINE_SPLIT=auto scripts/ripple_server.sh
```

- `QV_PIPELINE_SPLIT=auto` balances the two cards from the pack's per-layer sizes and each card's free memory. A number
  `k` puts layers `0..k-1` on the first card instead. For the qvb8 1e-3 pack on two 48 GB cards, `auto` picks 45 of the
  80 layers: about 32 GB of weights per card.
- `QV_PIPELINE_FIRST` (default: the other card, `cuda:1`) is the card of the first layers. The main card is the one
  `--device auto` resolves to, `cuda:0`; use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to choose which two cards are used.
- `QV_PIPELINE_MAIN_RESERVE_GB` (default 6) is what `auto` keeps aside on the main card for the drafter and the request
  tensors.
- The load log prints the split and what each card holds (`>>> pipeline: ...`); `scripts/ripple_server.sh status`
  shows both cards.
- Requests are served one at a time in this mode (the continuous-batching scheduler needs one card), and
  `--max-memory-gb` does not cap each card: a card that runs out of memory fails the request.
- Each KV-cache layer lives on its layer's card, so a long context grows on both cards.

**Status: not tested for Ripple.** Pipeline placement was developed on 2x V100 with the Qwen 27B. The Ripple path uses
the same loader and layer hooks, but it has not been run on two cards, so check a few answers against a single-card
run or the reference model before you rely on it.

## Supported options

The release supports GPU only. These are the supported settings (the defaults are in the launcher):

- `--kv-cache qvb8` (certified compressed KV) or `bf16`
- `--prefill-linear qvb8`
- `--drafter dflash`, `ngram` or none

Other values that the CLI help still lists, such as `--prefill-linear int8`, CPU or MTP drafters, are not part of
this release.

## Performance (DGX Spark, qvb8 1e-3 + 5e-3 drafter, greedy)

| Workload | Speed |
|---|---|
| Decode, code | ~15.8 tok/s |
| Decode, prose | ~4.5 tok/s |
| Two concurrent requests | ~18.7 tok/s aggregate |
| Prefill, 75k-token prompt | ~386 tok/s |

Speculative decoding is verified by the full model. In our tests, greedy output matched plain decoding; where two tokens are an
exact near-tie, the choice can differ.

## Update history

**v1.0.1**
- One switch for the compute dtype: `--dtype bf16|fp16` (replaces the `QV_MODEL_DTYPE` variable). The launchers set
  the default; nothing is chosen automatically.
- Two escape tables: an fp16 run reads only the fp16 table from `escape_tables.json`; a bf16 run reads the pack's full
  list. The pack files are unchanged. In our test (QVB8-1e-3, fp16, DGX Spark, one prompt, greedy) decoding went from
  about 1.8 to about 5.7 tokens per second; bf16 is unchanged.
- An fp16 run needs `escape_tables.json` in the pack folder; without it, the engine stops with an error at start-up.
- The server log: a client that hangs up before the reply (for example a start-up health check) is one `[http] ...` line, not a traceback; an fp16 run no longer prints the bf16 GEMM count as if it were in use.

**v1.0.0: First release**
- QVB8 Inference Engine for Ripple-65B-Preview, with the QVB8 and QVB8R weight packs.
